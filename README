* C Tidbits

This repository contains small useless C programs and tidbits.

* Build System

You can build all the programs with GNU `make` in the root directory.

The `Makefile` in the root directory has four targets: `all`, `test`, `run`, and `clean`,
and it runs make in each of the subdirectories.

* License

All this code is released under the AGPL3 license, as if it was of any use to anybody.
